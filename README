Text-CHM version 0.01
=====================

Text::CHM is a module that implements a (partial) support for handling
MS Compiled HtmlHelp Files (chm files for short) via CHMLib. CHMLib is
a small library designed for accessing MS ITSS files.  The ITSS file
format is used for chm files, which have been the predominant medium
for software documentation from Microsoft.

Chm is a filesystem based file format, such as MS Excel or MS Word
file formats, but they aren't the same.

Text::CHM allows you to open chm files, get their filelist, get the
content of each file and close them; at the moment, no write support
is available.
